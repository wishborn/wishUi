# Update Version

- First Increment the version in [composer.json](mdc:composer.json)
- use minor(0.0.1) for versions with small changes, confirm with user.
- use major(0.1.0) for versions with lots of changes, confirm with user.
- Then tag it in git after making sure recent changes are in sync.
- Never tag a repo without asking first.
